# myhnginternship
Herein chronicles my journey and experiences throughout the HNG Internship 6, beginning from StartNG! I am very grateful to be part of the programme. I believe it's going to be a very remarkable experience for me. I look forward to becoming a better software developer, with capabilities in Frontend & Backend development, as well as Machine Learning after the Internship!
